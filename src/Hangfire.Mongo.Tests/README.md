Hangfire.Mongo.Tests
====================

# Important Notice

We now have (.netcore) support for running unit test on macos and unix.

Please use Visual Studio Code if you want to run unit tests on macos or unix systems.

## MacOS
Unit tests are not detected when using *Visual Studio for Mac*. They do however compile. This will hopefully be supported soon.
